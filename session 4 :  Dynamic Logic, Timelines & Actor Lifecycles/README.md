# Session 4: Dynamic Logic, Timelines & Actor Lifecycles

This session is split into two parts: theory and practice, designed to deepen your understanding of dynamic systems in game development.

## Theory

In the theory section, we will explore key concepts including:  
- Timing mechanisms  
- Animation techniques  
- Actor control and lifecycle management  

## Practice

During the practical session, you'll apply these concepts through an interactive exercise:  
**Open and Close the Door**  

This hands-on activity will guide you through implementing timelines, event handling, and spawning logic to bring dynamic interactions to life.
