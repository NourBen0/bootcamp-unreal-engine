# Blueprint Communication – Part 1: **Direct Communication**

a lightweight project that demonstrates **Blueprint-to-Blueprint direct communication** in Unreal Engine. You’ll build a small scene where:

* 4 barriers block access to a zone with 3 collectible boxes.
* Only **one** barrier is active (`isOK = true`) and will open (rotate 90° on Z) when the player interacts.
* Each collectible box evaluates a simple equation `f(x) = ax + b = 0` using a function `calcul_x` and updates the **Score**.
* If a box’s result `x ≤ 0`, the game ends immediately.

> **Note**: The text says *quadratic*, but the formula shown is **linear** (`ax + b = 0`). This guide implements the **linear** case and computes `x = -b / a`. If you truly need a quadratic, replace `calcul_x` with a solver for `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` and adapt the rules accordingly.

---

## Scene Setup (Overview)

* **BP\_Barriere** × 4: StaticMesh + Box Collision, toggles open if `isOK`.
* **BP\_BoxCollectible** × 3: StaticMesh + Box Collision, evaluates `x` then updates score/visibility.
* **BP\_GameManager** (one actor): Stores score, exposes `AddScore()` and `EndGame()`.
* **Player**: Any Character/Controller capable of overlapping and pressing **E** to interact.

---

## STEP 1 — Create **BP\_Barriere**

**Goal:** a barrier (static mesh) that opens only if `isOK = true`.

1. **Blueprint**

* Add Blueprint Class → **Actor** → name it `BP_barriere`.

2. **Components**

* Add **Static Mesh** → assign your barrier mesh.
* Add **Box Collision** → surrounds the approach area.

3. **Variables**

* `isOK` (Boolean) → **Instance Editable** (checked) → default **false**.

4. **Interaction **

* Select the **Box Collision** → add the **OnComponentBeginOverlap** event.
* **Branch** → `isOK`?
  
  * **True**: Toggle open state.

    * If `bIsOpen` is **false** → **Play** timeline forward (open) and set `bIsOpen = true` on finish.
    * Else → **Reverse** timeline (close) and set `bIsOpen = false` on finish.
  * **False**: Optional **Print** "Barrier inactive".

6. **Timeline (Rotation)**

* Add **Timeline** `Rotation` (Length = `1s`).
* **Float Track** `Alpha` with keys: (0,0) → (1,1).
* On **Update**:

  * **Lerp (Rotator)** from (0,0,`ClosedYaw`) to (0,0,`OpenYaw`) using `Alpha`.
  * **Set Relative Rotation** on the Static Mesh.

---

## STEP 2 — Place **4 barrier instances**

* Drag 4x `BP_barriere` into the Level.
* In the **Details** panel per instance:

  * Set **exactly one** instance `isOK = true`.
  * Others remain `false`.
* Test: Only the `true` barrier should respond to **E** and open.

---

## STEP 3 — Create **BP\_GameManager** (Score & Game Over)

**Goal:** centralize score and end-game logic that other BPs can call **directly**.

1. **Blueprint**

* Add Blueprint Class → **Actor** → name it `BP_GameManager`.

2. **Variables**

* `Score` (Integer) → default **0**.

3. **Functions / Events**

* **Function** `AddScore(Delta: int)` → `Score += Delta` → optional on-screen print with new score.
* **Custom Event** `EndGame()` → e.g., Print "Game Over", disable player input, or open a Game Over UI/level.

4. **Place** one instance in the Level.

---

## STEP 4 — Create **BP\_BoxCollectible**

**Goal:** interact, compute `x = -b/a`, update score/visibility, and possibly end the game.

1. **Blueprint**

* Add Blueprint Class → **Actor** → name it `BP_BoxCollectible`.

2. **Components**

* **Static Mesh** (box mesh).
* **Box Collision** (interaction area).

3. **Variables**

* `a` (Float) → Instance Editable.
* `b` (Float) → Instance Editable.
* `GameManager` (Object Reference → **BP\_GameManager**) → **Instance Editable**.

4. **Function** `calcul_x()` → returns Float

* Guard: if `a == 0` → return a very negative value or 0 and **Print** "Invalid a".
* Else: `return -b / a`.

5. **Interaction **

* **Branch**: 

  * **True** → `x = calcul_x()`; set `xDebug = x` (optional display).

    * If `x > 0`:

      * **Set Hidden In Game = true** (mesh), **Set Collision Enabled = NoCollision**.
      * **GameManager.AddScore(+2)** (if valid).
      * (Optional) **Destroy Actor** after a short delay.
    * Else (`x ≤ 0`):

      * **GameManager.AddScore(-1)** (if valid).
      * `bInteractive = false` (box remains visible but no longer interacts).
      * **GameManager.EndGame()** (end immediately per rules).
  * **False** → do nothing (or Print "Box inactive").

> **Direct communication:** `BP_BoxCollectible` directly calls **functions** on `BP_GameManager` because `GameManager` is a **typed variable** (class = `BP_GameManager`). No casting, no interfaces — just a direct reference assigned in the level.

---

## STEP 5 — Level Wiring (Direct References)

* Place **1× BP\_GameManager** in the level.
* Place **3× BP\_BoxCollectible** in the level.

  * For each box instance:

    * Set `a`, `b` (choose values so you can test `x > 0` and `x ≤ 0`).
    * Assign **GameManager** by picking the placed `BP_GameManager` instance.
* Place **4× BP\_barriere** if not already.

  * Ensure only one has `isOK = true`.

<img width="1072" height="430" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9d22f82-14a7-4634-bec0-9675eb90d6ca" />

**Test flow:**

1. Approach barriers → only the active one opens with **E**.
2. Enter the zone → interact with boxes using **E**.
3. Each box computes `x` and updates the score.
4. On first `x ≤ 0`, **EndGame** fires immediately.

---

## Troubleshooting & Notes

* **a = 0** in `ax + b = 0` → undefined division. Protect against it.
* Always **Validate** references (e.g., `IsValid(GameManager)`) before calling.
* If you prefer **auto-open** barrier: move the `isOK` branch to **BeginOverlap** and call the timeline directly (no E key).
* Want randomness? Have `BP_GameManager` pick one barrier at **BeginPlay** and set its `isOK = true` (others false) by direct references.

---

## Why this is “Direct Communication”

* Blueprints store **explicit typed references** to other Blueprint classes.
* They call **variables/functions/events** on those references **directly**.
* No **Casting**, **Interfaces**, or **Dispatchers** yet.

> In the next parts, we’ll refactor the same scenario using: **Casting**, **Blueprint Interfaces**, and **Event Dispatchers** — showing when each pattern is cleaner, safer, or more scalable.

Perfect 👍 thanks for pasting the full **Part 1 (Direct Communication)** style.
Here’s **Part 2 (Casting)** rewritten in exactly the same style and formatting so your README flows consistently:

---

# Blueprint Communication – Part 2: **Casting (via GameMode)**

In this second version, we refactor the project to remove **direct references** and instead use **Casting** through the active **GameMode**.

* The player still faces **4 barriers** (one active) and **3 collectible boxes**.
* Barriers open the same way as before (`isOK` check).
* But now, **boxes no longer store a reference to BP\_GameManager**.
* Instead, they **Cast to BP\_ThirdPersonGameMode** and call a function there to update the score and handle Game Over.

---

## STEP 1 — Create **BP\_ThirdPersonGameMode**

**Goal:** centralize score & game logic inside the **GameMode**, replacing `BP_GameManager`.

1. **Blueprint**
   
Since BP_ThirdPersonGameMode already exists, we don’t need to create a new one.

   * Go to ThirdPerson → Blueprints → BP_ThirdPersonGameMode.
 
3. **Variables**

   * `Score` (Integer) → default `0`.

4. **Function CalcScore(x: float)**

   * If `x > 0`:

     * `Score += 2`
     * Hide the box (Set Hidden In Game, disable collision).
   * If `x ≤ 0`:

     * `Score -= 1`
     * Print "Game Over"
     * (Optional) Disable input / trigger Game Over UI.

---

## STEP 2 — Update **BP\_BoxCollectible**

**Goal:** instead of holding a direct `GameManager` reference, the Box communicates by **Casting to GameMode**.

1. On overlap:

   * Call the local `calcul_x()` function (same as Part 1).
   * Get the active GameMode → **Get Game Mode**.
   * **Cast to BP\_ThirdPersonGameMode**.
   * If cast succeeds → call `CalcScore(x)`.
   * Else → Print String `"GameMode not found"`.
   * The old `BP_GameManager` Actor is no longer needed.
   * Delete it from the Level.
   * All score logic is now centralized inside **GameMode**.

<img width="1287" height="707" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91e7d3f4-29da-48aa-bf5d-8c8b8feaf479" />

     
<img width="1427" height="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6d91bac-c342-4c3e-b657-d416e9e4d073" />

## Why this is “Casting”

* The Box doesn’t directly reference another Actor anymore.
* Instead, it uses Unreal’s **Get GameMode + Cast To** system.
* This makes the design more **modular**:

  * Only one place (GameMode) controls scoring & game-over.
  * You can swap or extend the logic without touching every Box.

Got it 👍 Here’s the **README-style Part 3** written in the exact same format as your previous parts (1 & 2):

---

# Blueprint Communication – Part 3: **Casting (via GameInstance)**

In this third version, we fix the main issue of **Casting via GameMode**:

👉 Every time we change level, the **GameMode resets** and the score goes back to `0`.

The solution: store persistent data in a **GameInstance** Blueprint, which survives across levels.

We’ll also create a teleportation actor (`BP_Teleportation`) to move the player into a second level (`Level2`), demonstrating how the score carries over.

---

## STEP 1 — Create **BP\_GameInstance**

**Goal:** centralize score & game logic in the GameInstance so it persists across levels.

1. **Blueprint**

   * Add → **Blueprint Class → GameInstance** → name it `BP_GameInstance`.

2. **Variables**

   * `Score` (Integer) → default `0`.

3. **Function `CalcScore(x: float)`**

   * If `x > 0`:

     * `Score += 2`
     * Hide the interacted box (Set Hidden In Game, disable collision).

   * If `x ≤ 0`:

     * `Score -= 1`
     * Print `"Game Over"`
     * (Optional) Disable input / trigger Game Over UI.

4. **Set Active GameInstance**

   * Go to **Project Settings → Maps & Modes → Game Instance Class**.
   * Set to **BP\_GameInstance**.

✅ Now `Score` will persist across levels.

---

## STEP 2 — Update **BP\_BoxCollectible**

**Goal:** instead of casting to GameMode, the Box communicates via **GameInstance**.

1. On overlap:

   * Call the local `calcul_x()` function.
   * Use **Get Game Instance**.
   * **Cast to BP\_GameInstance**.
   * If cast succeeds → call `CalcScore(x)`.
   * Else → Print String `"GameInstance not found"`.

> This replaces the **GameMode cast** from Part 2.

---

## STEP 3 — Create **BP\_Teleportation**

**Goal:** teleport the player into `Level2` and show that the score persists.

1. **Blueprint**

   * Add → **Blueprint Class → Actor** → name it `BP_Teleportation`.

2. **Components**

   * Add a **Static Mesh** (any shape for the teleport area).
   * Add a **Box Collision** around it.

3. **Logic**

   * On **Box Collision → OnComponentBeginOverlap**:

     * Get Overlapping Actor → check if it’s the Player.
     * If yes → use **Open Level (Level2)**.

---

## STEP 4 — Create **Level2**

1. Add a new Level → name it `Level2`.
2. Place a few actors (barriers, boxes, or just a floor) for testing.
3. Place another `BP_Teleportation` if you want to teleport back to the first level.
